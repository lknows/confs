My many configuration files that I've poured hours of sweat into for optimal efficiency and aesthetics.


I like tinkering with configuration files to optimize my OS's tools and applications. I don't want to lose all the effort I put into these files, so I've created a repo just for them. I don't advocate the use of these files on other's machines, it is strictly for me and my idiocy. Read the disclaimer below before peaking.

I do not claim ownership for every file in this repository. I made minimal changes to the original files, but these changes took time and a lot of "trial-and-error" to get exactly how I wanted. I'm not claiming authorship of any code within this repo. If any copyright infringement or lack of credit is present, I apologize. I know this is a public repo, but I have no intentions of advertising or advocating the use of the files within and will accept no responsibility for what these files do (or don't do). I will pull the entire repository down immediately at request if anyone believes I have malcontent intentions.
